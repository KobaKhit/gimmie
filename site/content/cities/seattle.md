  - name: Black Farmers Collective
    description: >-
      The Black Farmers Collective is a group of urban food system activists
      dedicated to providing opportunities to improve the health of our
      communities through all aspects of the food system. Their vision is based
      in the need for a place for African American leadership on the land, the
      Kwanzaa principle of cooperative economics, and the realization that
      mitigating the climate crisis requires action to support local production,
      carbon sequestration, and natural habitat creation.

      Addressing the barriers BIPOC communities face accessing food has been a
      focal point of Villa Comunitaria's efforts! Through the pandemic, Villa
      has successfully implemented outreach and enrollment for Food Vouchers to
      help low-income, BIPOC families access healthy produce and groceries for
      themselves and their families. Your donation would allow our efforts to
      expand and address the continuous disproportionate barriers families of
      color face accessing essential food to nurture their families. All
      donations are greatly appreciated from our diverse and beautiful
      communities.

  - name: Tilth - Rainier Beach Urban Farm
    description: >-
      Tilth Alliance launched a pay-what-you-can farm stand at Rainier Beach
      Urban Farm & Wetlands last summer during a global pandemic. The weekly
      market acted as not only an access point for fresh, local and organically
      grown produce, but also as a space for the community to connect, get
      outside and enjoy the public parks property on which it operates. Rainier
      Beach Urban Farm and Wetlands is 8 acres to explore and learn, tucked
      within a residential South Seattle neighborhood.

      The Shared Spaces Foundation is a nonprofit based in Seattle, WA focused
      on restorative justice through land restoration and sustainable education.
      In partnership with many local communities and organizations they are
      working towards bringing a green shared space back to life in the Duwamish
      River Valley. Shared Spaces plans to upgrade an existing but outdated 65'
      greenhouse and build an outdoor nursery. Once renovated, they will be able
      to grow native plants, fruits, vegetables and berries, using the space to
      provide education and sustenance for the Duwamish Tribe and the
      surrounding communities. They also plan to use this space to host
      workshops and educational programs on urban farming, plant restoration,
      and much more.
