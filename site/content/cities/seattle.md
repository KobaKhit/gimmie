  - name: Black Farmers Collective
    description: >-
      The Black Farmers Collective is a group of urban food system activists
      dedicated to providing opportunities to improve the health of our
      communities through all aspects of the food system. Their vision is based
      in the need for a place for African American leadership on the land, the
      Kwanzaa principle of cooperative economics, and the realization that
      mitigating the climate crisis requires action to support local production,
      carbon sequestration, and natural habitat creation.

      who are mostly living alone or couples living by themselves.   The lunch
      program is monitored by Seattle King County Public Health.  A dietician
      inspects the food service every month to make sure the seniors are served
      with culturally appropriate food.
