  - name: Black Farmers Collective
    description: >-
      The Black Farmers Collective is a group of urban food system activists
      dedicated to providing opportunities to improve the health of our
      communities through all aspects of the food system. Their vision is based
      in the need for a place for African American leadership on the land, the
      Kwanzaa principle of cooperative economics, and the realization that
      mitigating the climate crisis requires action to support local production,
      carbon sequestration, and natural habitat creation.

  - name: Tilth - Rainier Beach Urban Farm
    description: >-
      Tilth Alliance launched a pay-what-you-can farm stand at Rainier Beach
      Urban Farm & Wetlands last summer during a global pandemic. The weekly
      market acted as not only an access point for fresh, local and organically
      grown produce, but also as a space for the community to connect, get
      outside and enjoy the public parks property on which it operates. Rainier
      Beach Urban Farm and Wetlands is 8 acres to explore and learn, tucked
      within a residential South Seattle neighborhood.
