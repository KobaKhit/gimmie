    As the pandemic keeps affecting the most vulnerable of us it is great to have recieved
    the stimulus package. With the announcement of the new stimulus package and after reflecting on
    what can we do better this time around we decided to give people an opportunity to donate  all or portion 
    of your stimulus payment to the local non profits.

    The first stimulus payments were <a class = 'link' href="https://blog.gao.gov/2020/04/14/as-aid-for-covid-19-arrives-so-might-fraud-heres-how-you-can-report-it/" target = "_blank">grossly missappropriated</a> and a large portion did not reach the ones
    who needed it the most. We have an opportunity to make a difference during historically large scale crisis. 
    We will honor you with a certificate and publish your profile on our website if you so wish once you donate to a local 
    non profit.
