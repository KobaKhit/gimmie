    Shaken by the Covid-19 pandemic, we began a collective diary to share our
    perspectives and memorialize a historic time. We spend much of our time
    taking in information from the media, our leaders, our friends and family,
    and strangers on the internet. Now, we turn inward to reflect upon our own
    experiences and how the chaos has affected each of us. With many voices, we
    hope to create a community through shared experiences around the world.
