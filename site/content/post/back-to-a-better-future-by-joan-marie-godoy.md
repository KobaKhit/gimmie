It’s been almost 50 days since I started spending a huge amount of hours at home. Some days have been great, some days have been tough, some days are just blurry. Funny enough, since most of us have been stuck inside, I’ve been able to observe the world better.

The good days I smile. On good days, my eyes get teary after feeling so much joy. This unwanted yet necessary confinement seems to have brought so much good. There’s solidarity and kindness everywhere you look. People talk to neighbors who used to be strangers, even from building to building. Can you believe that? Kids write positive messages on the street to cheer up random pedestrians. We’re clapping at nurses and doctors we don’t really know. Celebrities and leaders are opening their doors to their messy homes. Women are letting their hair and skin breathe as they wear less makeup and beauty salons are closed.

The list goes on. Relationships are our most valuable possession and mental health our most valuable resource. Animals are happy and free. Restaurant owners are giving away food to those who can’t afford it. Evictions have paused. Governments have created hospitals and shelters in almost no time. My friends and family in Guatemala now appreciate the silence and the lack of traffic. Americans are realizing how nice it is not having to rush all the time and how pretty streets are when built for people (not cars). Friends in India are grateful to have personal space and friends in Europe are understanding how necessary belonging to a community is.

The bad days I’m angry. On bad days, it’s hard to breathe after feeling so much frustration. It’s impressive how the media influences us. Who decides what they tell us? It’s unbelievable how much time we waste watching fake news or ignorant people sharing half told truths. It’s crazy how the world keeps venerating a country that has its priorities upside down. It’s shocking how little we know about leaders doing things right for their people.

The list goes on. How is it that we’re just realizing how important agricultural workers are? They get paid nothing. Do we appreciate the people that pick up our nasty trash? Ha! We finally understand how heroic and resourceful teachers are. Change is possible I see. It’s now evident that we just didn’t want to try.

Today I wonder... Will we learn that without health, sense of belonging, and community we’re nothing? Will we realize that fame, power, and status are just a product of our collective imagination? Will we start venerating the people who serve? Will we admire the ones who problem-solve? Will we respect the planet we call home?

Will we go back to a better future? Can most of us at least give it a try?
