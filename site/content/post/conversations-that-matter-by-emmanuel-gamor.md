End of May, months into lockdown and Africa “month” commemorated by the African Union. And as we celebrate the strides towards a consolidated African economy community, and recognize the many strides made in the past especially during the coronavirus pandemic, I'm reminded of the [power of ideas](https://www.4irafrica.co/) that lead to insightful conversations that push movements to become institution-bound and operationalized for the Africa we want. Looking onward; I am excited to share [*The Pathfinders* conversation](https://www.eagamor.com/event/heavychef-the-pathfinders-live/) I shall be having with H.E. Olusegun Obasanjo (former president, Nigeria) & Dr. Greg Mills on June 9th, 2020 where I shall be irreverent with much needed community-interventions exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. ​

[Heavy Chef](https://www.heavychef.com/) and [Fred](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredroed/) also invited me for a [deep-dive conversation](https://www.heavychef.com/articles/2020/5/21/african-culture-is-key-to-unlocking-innovation-podcast-host-emmanuel-gamor) ahead of the event, to get a flavor of my thoughts and submissions on what our what-next looks like. A bit of what I shall be sharing is a culmination of conversations that I have been privileged to have with amazing African professionals in the fields of entrepreneurship, tech, healthcare and most recently education on the [Unpacking Africa](https://www.4irafrica.co/) podcast.

Fauzia Issaka is a development professional pursuing a doctoral degree in the United Kingdom.

Her submissions interrogate how parents and teachers may vet the learning competence of their wards this academic year due to the challenges of homeschooling during the pandemic.

These podcast conversations help me live outside of my apartment during lock down that I hope eases soon.
