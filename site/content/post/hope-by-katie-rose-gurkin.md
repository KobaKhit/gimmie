Hope is the view across the table

The game aside to break the family bread.

Eyes on the view of just the four of us.

No need to check the news,

let the waves crash as they must

steady as chaos around the table,

just the four of us.

And for a moment the world pauses

so our real life can begin.

.

This laughter that will save us,

While thrones are sinking like stones.

The arch of smiles and tears from equal seats

Bridge the crest between the light of presence

and imagined darkness.

When our table again greets the shore,

great depths difference than the souls we were before,

Our masks will have drifted towards the bottom

While we let our troubles slide happily once again.

Perhaps it’s the floor falling beneath us

That shows us the door to the placidness within.

.

Hope is the steadiness of life looking for love.

Mirrors in one another that show us we’re enough.

The world crashed hard around us

But we smiled through it all.

It rings true the paradox of forgiving,

the more we give away

the more that we are given.

Cousin gave up his job to create a life worth living.

I trust this wood is good and carries us to the true call.

When we gaze across the table

And remember why this life’s worth living after all.
