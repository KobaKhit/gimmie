Herd – a pretty unflattering word.

A sub-group of specie banned together –

Who’s the leader?

It’s hard to tell…

Onward they move.

Hunt, rest and migrate –

Predict the economy, predict the weather –

A sanguine prediction from the ringleader –

It’s hard to tell…

Hunker down for now.

We’re one big herd.

Farm, sell, and teach –

And wow, how we can communicate with ease –

On a broad platform, or bilaterally to the ones we trust,

Amazing, how we can comply.

Are we ready? Or are we reluctant?

What’s the trajectory of our fate?

Has this been excessive? Should we continue to wait?

What can we control?

As one big herd –
